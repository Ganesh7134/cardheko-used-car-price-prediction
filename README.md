# cardheko-used-car-price-prediction

This project develops a data science solution for accurate used car price prediction, empowering users to make informed decisions when buying or selling.

## Key Objectives

- Acquire and preprocess a comprehensive used car dataset.
- Explore and understand data characteristics and relationships.
- Engineer relevant features for better prediction.
- Train and evaluate diverse machine learning models.
- hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance if we want to improve further

## Technical Stack (replace with your specific choices)

- Python (data analysis, machine learning)
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- NumPy (numerical computations)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms)

## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

- Public dataset scrapped from cardheko website
- Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Standardize/normalize numerical features.
- Create informative features through appropriate techniques.

## Exploration and Feature Engineering

- Conduct EDA to uncover patterns and trends.
- Visualize data distributions, correlations, and outliers.
- Identify feature-price relationships.
- Create new features (e.g., one-hot encodings) to enhance model performance.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- Experiment with various machine learning algorithms.
- Train models with cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results.


## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a valuable tool for estimating used car prices, enabling informed decision-making. We strive for continuous improvement by incorporating new data, exploring advanced techniques
